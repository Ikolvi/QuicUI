## 1.0.2 - October 30, 2025

### ðŸŽ¯ Backend-Optional & Examples Update

**Architecture Improvements**
- âœ… Backend is now completely optional - QuicUI works standalone with local JSON
- âœ… Clarified that `initializeWithDataSource()` is optional for cloud features only
- âœ… Framework can render JSON directly without any backend initialization
- âœ… Updated all documentation to reflect optional backend integration
- âœ… Plugin-based architecture remains flexible for any backend

**New Examples**
- âœ… Added Scaffold Counter App example (`examples/scaffold_counter_app.dart`)
- âœ… Demonstrates Material Design with Scaffold, AppBar, FloatingActionButton
- âœ… Shows state management and JSON-based UI rendering
- âœ… Counter JSON schema added to README with complete example

**Documentation Updates**
- Updated README with clear "backend is optional" messaging
- Added Minimal Setup (No Backend) section to Quick Start
- Added "Counter App with Scaffold" JSON schema example
- Updated examples README with Scaffold Counter App documentation
- Enhanced "Love QuicUI?" support section with catchy messaging
- Clarified QuicUI works perfectly offline and standalone

**Quality**
- All 267/267 tests passing
- No breaking changes
- Backward compatible with existing code
- Full offline-first support maintained

**Key Takeaway**
QuicUI is a standalone JSON rendering engine that *optionally* integrates with backends.
Use it locally, offline, or connect to cloud - your choice!

/// Widget builder for constructing Flutter widgets from JSON
///
/// Provides utility methods for building individual widgets from JSON definitions.
/// This is an internal component of the UIRenderer rendering pipeline.

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

/// Builds individual widgets from JSON
///
/// Utility class that constructs Flutter widgets based on JSON type and properties.
/// Used internally by UIRenderer during the rendering pipeline.
class WidgetBuilder {
  /// Build a widget from type and properties
  ///
  /// Constructs a Flutter widget instance from a JSON widget definition.
  /// This method is called recursively by UIRenderer to build the full widget tree.
  ///
  /// ## Parameters
  /// - [type]: Widget type identifier (e.g., 'container', 'column', 'text')
  /// - [properties]: Widget configuration properties from JSON
  ///
  /// ## Returns
  /// Flutter Widget instance created according to JSON specification
  ///
  /// ## Implementation
  /// This delegates to UIRenderer.renderWidget() which provides:
  /// - Type validation and error handling
  /// - Property extraction and conversion
  /// - Nested widget rendering
  /// - State management integration
  ///
  /// ## Example
  /// ```dart
  /// final jsonWidget = {
  ///   'type': 'text',
  ///   'properties': {'text': 'Hello World'}
  /// };
  /// final widget = WidgetBuilder.buildWidget(
  ///   jsonWidget['type'],
  ///   jsonWidget['properties']
  /// );
  /// ```
  ///
  /// See also:
  /// - [UIRenderer]: Main rendering engine (use this instead)
  static Widget buildWidget(String type, Map<String, dynamic> properties) {
    // Delegated to UIRenderer.renderWidget() for full rendering pipeline
    // including type validation, property extraction, and state management
    return const SizedBox(
      child: Placeholder(),
    );
  }
